# **Piecewise Constant Curvature (PCC) Modeling**

This repository contains the exercises and materials related to **Piecewise Constant Curvature (PCC)** modeling for soft robotics, as presented by **Dr. Alessandro Albini**. This work focuses on the modeling, transformation, and kinematic behavior of flexible robotic segments.

## **Overview**

### **Description**
The goal of this repository is to model and analyze the configuration of soft robots in 3D space using the assumption of constant curvature for flexible segments. The modeling approach simplifies complex deformations by approximating each segment's curvature.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Kinematic Model of Soft Robots:** Soft robots are modeled using continuous bending assumptions for flexible segments.
- **Forward Kinematics (FK):** The FK equations are derived for both in-plane and out-of-plane transformations of robot segments.
- **Multi-Segment Modeling:** The project extends to multiple segments and addresses tip-frame alignment, arc parameters derivation, and more.

## **Contents**

- **Forward Kinematics in Plane:** Models transformation of arcs using specific parameters (radius and angles).
- **Out-of-Plane Rotation:** Introduction of rotation angle Ï† to extend the arc's transformation.
- **Multi-Segment Extension Exercises:** Exercises to visualize and extend modeling to multiple segments.

### **Exercises Included**
1. **Exercise 1:** Drawing points of an arc defined by given parameters and creating the transformation matrix.
2. **Exercise 2.a:** Extending in-plane arcs with out-of-plane rotations.
3. **Exercise 2.b & 2.c:** Rotational alignment of the frame along the arc and representation using arc parameters.
4. **Exercise 3 & 4:** Multi-segment arcs visualization, frame drawing, and arc parameter derivation based on motion capture data.
